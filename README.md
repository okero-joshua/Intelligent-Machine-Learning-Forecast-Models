In this project, we use machine learning models to predict sales forecasts for a client. We aim to identify the best-performing models and feature sets using Azure AutoML, followed by manual tuning to further enhance prediction accuracy. The models are evaluated using metrics such as R² scores, MAPE, and others to ensure reliability and performance. Our objective is to develop a robust forecasting solution that supports the client’s strategic planning and decision-making.
